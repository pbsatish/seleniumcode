REST API Testing:
REST API testing is not very difficult compared to selenium web driver UI testing. Most of the APIs should be one of GET / POST / PUT / PATCH / DELETE  requests.

GET is used to get information from the back end to show in the UI
POST is used to add new information into the back end.
PUT is used to update / replace any existing information.
PATCH is for partial update
DELETE is used to delete the information from the back end.
